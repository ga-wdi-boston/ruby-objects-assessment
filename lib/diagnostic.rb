# For questions which ask for a response but do not provide a
# `Response.something =` assignment, write code that meets the requirements
# using idiomatic and conventional Ruby. Running the tests and carefully
# inspecting messages can help if you've named something incorrectly.
#
# For questions which **do** provide a `Response.something =` assignment, you
# should replace whatever is assigned with your answer. For example, if the
# answer to a question is the `true` boolean:
#
#   ```diff
#   - Response.wdi_is_awesome = nil
#   + Response.wdi_is_awesome = true
#   ```

# HouseCat class inherits from Cat, then Animal
class HouseCat < Cat

  end
end

## What will be the output from calling `HouseCat.new.say_hello`?
# replace nil with your response
Response.housecat_noise = "I am a HouseCat, and I go meow"

## Explain why this would be the output, based on the method lookup chain.
# your response as a comment here
##
the say_hello pulls from the class animal.  since the housecat is the chid
of the cat is the chid of anial it will put the string of "I am a etc etc"
{self.class.name} in the string will use the housecat and the sound will use
the @sound for house cat = string for meow

# Define a new class, 'Lion', which (a) inherits from 'Cat',
