# For questions which ask for a response but do not provide a
# `Response.something =` assignment, write code that meets the requirements
# using idiomatic and conventional Ruby. Running the tests and carefully
# inspecting messages can help if you've named something incorrectly.
#
# For questions which **do** provide a `Response.something =` assignment, you
# should replace whatever is assigned with your answer. For example, if the
# answer to a question is the `true` boolean:
#
#   ```diff
#   - Response.wdi_is_awesome = nil
#   + Response.wdi_is_awesome = true
#   ```

# Create a Person class, with attributes name, age, and location. All three
# attributes should be defined when you instantiate a new Person. Name should be
# readable and writeable, age should only be readable, and location should only
# be writable.

##
# your response here
##

##
# Instatiate a new Person object using arguments "Dave", 32, and "Ohio".
# Then, in the next line, change this Person's location property to
# "Somerville". Finally, assign the modified Person to `Response.dave` below.

## replace nil with your response, then continue your work on the next line
dave = dave
Response.dave = dave

##
# Create another class called Developer that inherits from Person.
# Give it a new instance method called 'solve_problems',
# which returns the string "think think think".

##
class Developer < Person
  def initialize
    @solve_problems = "think think think"
  end

##
# Study the code below before responding.
# Then, in a comment on the next line,

class Animal
  def initialize
    @sound = nil
  end

  def say_hello
    puts "I am a #{self.class.name}, and I go '#{@sound}'"
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def groom
    puts 'lick... lick...'
  end
end

class HouseCat < Cat
  def initialize
    @sound = 'meow'
  end
end

## What will be the output from calling `HouseCat.new.say_hello`?
# replace nil with your response
Response.housecat_noise = I am a cat, and I go 'meow'.

## Explain why this would be the output, based on the method lookup chain.
'Cat' is the parent that "HouseCat" inherits from. and the new.say_hello is a
string that also has the sound placed in it.

# Define a new class, 'Lion', which (a) inherits from 'Cat',
# (b) uses the 'Carnivorous' module below as a mixin, and
# (c) adds a new method called `roar`, which prints out "ROAR!"

class Lion < Cat

module Carnivorous
  def can_eat_meat?
    true
  end

  def eat_meat(food)
    if food.class == 'Animal'
      puts "NOM NOM NOM. #{food.class} is delicious"
    else
      puts 'Yuck!'
    end
  end

def ROAR
  puts "ROAR"
end

# #
# What are some of the advantages of using composition (i.e. mixins)
# over using direct inheritance?

##
mixins help make things easier by being able to just add certain methods or
attributes together instead of writing out code for every new class you include
in your code.

# Fix the 'ComboAttack' class below so that calling
# `ComboAttack.new.punch.move('left').kick.damage` doesn't cause an error.
#
# Then, create a new class method called "get_possible_moves",
# which returns the string "kick, move, punch"

class ComboAttack
  attr_reader :moves, :damage

  def initialize
    @moves = []
    @damage = 0
  end

  def punch
    @moves << 'punch'
    @damage += 5
