# For questions which ask for a response but do not provide a
# `Response.something =` assignment, write code that meets the requirements
# using idiomatic and conventional Ruby. Running the tests and carefully
# inspecting messages can help if you've named something incorrectly.
#
# For questions which **do** provide a `Response.something =` assignment, you
# should replace whatever is assigned with your answer. For example, if the
# answer to a question is the `true` boolean:
#
#   ```diff
#   - Response.wdi_is_awesome = nil
#   + Response.wdi_is_awesome = true
#   ```

# Create a Person class, with attributes name, age, and location. All three
# attributes should be defined when you instantiate a new Person. Name should be
# readable and writeable, age should only be readable, and location should only
# be writable.

  attr_accessor :name
  attr_reader :age
  attr_writer :location

# Instatiate a new Person object using arguments "Dave", 32, and "Ohio".
# Then, in the next line, change this Person's location property to
# "Somerville". Finally, assign the modified Person to `Response.dave` below.

# Create another class called Developer that inherits from Person.

# Study the code below before responding.

# Animal Class
class Animal
  def initialize
    @sound = nil
  end

  def say_hello
    puts "I am a #{self.class.name}, and I go '#{@sound}'"
  end
end

# Cat Class inherits from Animal
class Cat < Animal
  def groom
    puts 'lick... lick...'
  end
end

# HouseCat class inherits from Cat, then Animal
class HouseCat < Cat
  def initialize
    @sound = 'meow'
  end
end

## What will be the output from calling `HouseCat.new.say_hello`?
# replace nil with your response
Response.housecat_noise = 'meow'

## Explain why this would be the output, based on the method lookup chain.
# this would be the answer because in the animal class it has an instance of @sound
# the HouseCat class defines sound as meow. Also HouseCat inherits from Cat which
# inherits from the Animal class where the method to do the sound as output is
#done.

##
# Define a new class, 'Lion', which (a) inherits from 'Cat',
# (b) uses the 'Carnivorous' module below as a mixin, and
# (c) adds a new method called `roar`, which prints out "ROAR!"

module Carnivorous
  def can_eat_meat?
    true

  def eat_meat(food)

# #
# What are some of the advantages of using composition (i.e. mixins)
# over using direct inheritance?

##
# one of the advantages of doing this is that instead of only being able to inherit
# 2 layers of classes, using the mixins allows this to happen 'to infinity'. It
# might not be the cleanest or the most dry, effective way to do it, but it
# definitely would be better than direct inheritance since there are only 2 layers

# Fix the 'ComboAttack' class below so that calling
